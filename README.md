04 March, 2022

# About

  - TMTPrePro is a set of scripts developed at the Australian Proteome
    Analysis Facility several years ago, for the analysis of TMT data.
  - The reference can be found
    **[here](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-6740-7_5)**
  - There is an original **[Github
    site](https://github.com/APAFbioinformatics/TMTPrePro)** where a
    first version of the code was placed, but it is no longer actively
    maintained.
